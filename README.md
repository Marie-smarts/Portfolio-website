# Vanessa Obudho | Software Engineer Portfolio 👩🏾‍💻

Hi there! This is my personal portfolio website. It's simple, clean, and handmade using just HTML and CSS — no JavaScript, no frameworks. Just vibes and growth.

It’s where I introduce myself, show a glimpse of my projects, and let people know how to reach me.

## 🌟 What’s Inside

- A fixed header with buttons that bounce when you hover over them
- Three main sections:
  - **About** – who I am, what I love
  - **Projects** – things I’m building
  - **Contact** – how to find me
- Soft colors, rounded corners, clean layout
- Styled with care using pure CSS

---

## 💻 How I Built It

I used:
- HTML5
- CSS3 (with transitions and animations)
- A lot of trial and error
- A little help from ChatGPT 😌(Honestly a good tool for a beginner)

This project was my way of practicing how websites really work — starting from scratch and learning step by step. I wanted it to feel like *me*.

## 👩🏾‍💻 A Little About Me

I’m an aspiring software engineer from Nairobi, Kenya 🇰🇪. I love building things from scratch, solving problems with code, and learning as I go. When I’m not behind a screen, I’m probably reading a thriller novel or cooking to unwind.

This website is just the beginning.

## 🚀 What’s Next?

- Make it mobile responsive
- Add actual project links
- Keep learning C, front-end, and other cool stuff
- Maybe make a version with JavaScript later
